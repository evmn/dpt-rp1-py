# dpt-rp1-py
Python script to manage Sony DPT-RP1 without Digital Paper App. This repository includes a Python library and a command line utility to manage documents on the DPT-RP1. Tested on Windows, Linux, and macOS. 

## Install

To install the library run `python3 setup.py install` or `pip3 install .` from the root directory. To install as a developer use `python3 setup.py develop` (see [the setuptools docs](http://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#development-mode)) and work on the source as usual.

Installing the package also installs the command line utility called `dptrp1`.

## Using the command line utility
```
dptrp1 \
	--addr <DPT-RP1 hostname or IP address> \
	--client-id <client_id file> \
	--key <key file> \
	command [arguments]
```
The required files for the client ID and private key will be created when you first register the reader. The files can also be extracted from the original Digital Paper App.

### Supported commands
You can get a list of the implemented commands by running `dptrp1` with no additional arguments. Supported commands include _register_, _list-documents_, _download <remote path> [<local path>]_, _upload <local path> <remote path>_, _new-folder <new folder path>_, _delete <remote_path>_, _wifi-list_, _wifi-scan_, _wifi-enable_, and _wifi-disable_.

Note that the root path for DPT-RP1 is `Document/`.
- Example command to download a document `file.pdf` from the root folder ("System Storage") of DPT-RP1: `dptrp1 --client-id ~/deviceid.dat --key ~/privatekey.dat --addr 10.0.0.4 download Document/file.pdf ./file.pdf`
- Example command to upload a document `file.pdf` to a folder named `Articles` on DPT-RP1: `dptrp1 --client-id ~/deviceid.dat --key ~/privatekey.dat --addr 10.0.0.4 upload ./file.pdf Document/Articles/file.pdf`

#### Update 2019-02-09

**I've set default `client-id`, `key` and `addr` in `bin/dptrp1` file. Now you can operate with simpler commands**

 - List Documents: ` dptrp1 ls`
 - List Folders: `dptrp1 ldir` 
 - Upload File: `dptrp1 push /local/path/file.pdf dptrp1/folder/`
 The default upload path is `Document/`, you only need to specify DPT-RP1 folder if you want upload to other folder.
 - Download File: `dptrp1 pull dptrp1/file.pdf local/path/`
 - Delete File: `dptrp1 rm dptrp1/file.pdf` 
 - Delete Folder: `dptrp1 rm tmp/`
 - Make New Folder: `dptrp1 mkdir dptrp1/folder/`

There seems no way to change file/folder name.

### Registering the DPT-RP1

The DPT-RP1 uses SSL encryption to communicate with the computer.  This
requires registering the DPT-RP1 with the computer, which results in 
two pieces of information -- the client ID and the key file -- that you'll need to run the script.  You can get this information in three ways.

#### Registering without the Digital Paper App
This method requires your DPT-RP1 and your computer to be on the same network segment via WiFi, Bluetooth or a USB connection. The USB connection works on Windows on macOS but may not work on a Linux machine. If you the USB connection does not work for you, perform the initial setup on a different PC to connect the reader to your WiFi network.

Second, find the DPT-RP1's IP address. If you're on WiFi, go to 
_Wi-Fi Settings_ on the device and tap the connected network. If you're
on Bluetooth, it's likely _172.25.47.1_. You can also try the hostname _digitalpaper.local_.

Finally, use the _register_ command, substituting the files you want the client ID and key written to, and the IP address of the device:

```
dptrp1 \
	--client-id <client_id file> \
	--key <key file> \
	--addr <address> \
	register
```

If you get an error, wait a few seconds and try again.  Sometimes it takes two or three tries to work.

#### Finding the private key and client ID on Windows

If you have already registered on Windows, the Digital Paper app stores the files in _Users/{username}/AppData/Roaming/Sony Corporation/Digital Paper App/_. You'll need the files _deviceid.dat_ and _privatekey.dat_.

#### Finding the private key and client ID on macOS

If you have already registered on macOS, the Digital Paper app stores the files in _$HOME/Library/Application Support/Sony Corporation/Digital Paper App/_. You'll need the files _deviceid.dat_ and _privatekey.dat_.
